## Setup

Basically... there's only a few things you need to do.

1. Install an Operating System on an SD card with the raspberry pi imager.
2. Power up the pi
3. clone this repository
4. set up the pi as a wifi hotspot ([instructions here](https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/raspberry-pi-access-point))
5. run the install script (start.sh)
6. enjoy!


## Why?

Because it was cool!  And because I didn't want to pay $500 for a GoPro
for my nephew.  Furthermore, I have other projects which could use a tool which could record video.
